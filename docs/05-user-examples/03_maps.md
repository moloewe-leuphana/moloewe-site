## <Highlighthead> **Required Skills & Software** </Highlighthead>

- GIS
- Python
- Gitlab

## <Highlighthead> **How to start** </Highlighthead>

There are **two ways** to incorporate a map in MoLöWe: [Here's a simple flowchart](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfd4oZ8=/?share_link_id=811493081374)

If your gis file (e.g. shapefile) is…
- **smaller** than 45 Mb: use **Mapbox**
- **bigger** than 45 Mb: create a map **locally** in a GIS and load it as an image file (either from the MoLöWe-Server or from Git-repo) into MoLöWe


In the following, the two ways are presented in detail. Example maps, their data and python codes are given. The examples are intended to give you a glimpse into what’s possible with maps in the MoLöWe.

---

:::tip Before you start

You can copy/paste the given python codes in your notebook and adjust them to your needs. However, you must import the following modules in your notebook first:

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

Also, you need to define a mapbox token at the beginning of your notebook, such as:

```python
mapbox_access_token = "pk.eyJ1IjoibW9sb2V3ZSIsImEiOiJjanprMzFkODUwMnJyM29vM3lwYWNwMG5jIn0.ElIGswv7z_KNHyivxm9yrg"
```
:::

## <Highlighthead> **Mapbox** </Highlighthead>

### <Highlightsubhead> Using Mapbox </Highlightsubhead>

All GIS processing and plotting is happening “from scratch” each time you access the slide (using the files imported to the MoLöWe-Server for the project).

#### <Highlight> Pros </Highlight>
- interactivity: you can freely zoom, navigate and turn off elements in the map
- hovertext
- wide range of basemaps to ease orientation

#### <Highlight> Cons </Highlight>
- difficulties loading larger (?mb) file sizes
- plotting time depends on amount of data points: plotting large amount of data points will take a while

---

:::tip Before you start
In order to use shape files in your maps, you must import the shape files with all of their extensions to the MoLöWe-Server. Supported formats on the Server are .shp, .shx, .prj and .dbf (cpg-files are not supported).
:::

### <Highlightsubhead> Scatter Plot </Highlightsubhead>

Mapbox Scatter plots can be built from either a **coordinate table** (long & lat) or from a **point shape file**.

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

Each dot is a tree, the color representing its health aka. its “score”. Hovering over a tree will show its coordinates and description of health (”excellent”, “good” or “unfit”). The source data is a point shapefile previously uploaded to the MoLöWe-Server (using a coordinate table would also be possible, see python code below).

#### <Highlight> Source Data (Sample) </Highlight>

| lat | lon | text | score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 53.2645 | 10.3985 | excellent | 1 |
| 53.2646 | 103.985 | excellent | 1 |
| 53.2634 | 10.3981 | good | 2 |
| 53.2647 | 10.3981 | unfit | 4 |

#### <Highlight> Python Code </Highlight>

```python
def get_tree_map(self):

  # load point shapefile (from the MoLöWe-Server) as geodataframe
  trees = gpd.read_file(data + "trees.shp")
  # Note: The EPSG of the example data is 4326

  # The EPSG of your data must be 4326 to work in mapbox. If it's not, you could re-project it:
  # trees = trees.to_crs(epsg=4326)
  # Since the EPSG of the example data is already in 4326, we don't need to re-project it
  
  # You can also generate a geodataframe from a coordinate table:
  # trees = pd.read_csv(text + "trees.txt", sep=";")
  # trees = gpd.GeoDataFrame(trees, crs="EPSG:4326", geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(trees.lon, trees.lat))
  # Note: The second argument is the EPSG of the data. If it's not already 4326, you must re-project it (see above)

  
  # plot

```

### <Highlightsubhead> Scatter Plot with Dropdown List </Highlightsubhead>

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

Same as in previous example, however, now we can restrict the map to trees that belong to a certain health category (”excellent”, “good” or “unfit”) using a dropdown list. Hovering over a tree will show its coordinates and score.

Note: After making a selection in the dropdown list, the map must be refreshed (in the upper right corner of the map) to apply the changes.

  # Note:

### <Highlightsubhead> Choropleth Map - Continuous Color Scale </Highlightsubhead>

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

Buildings are colored according to their height. The source data is a shape file (imported to the MoLöWe-Server). Hovering over a building will show its index in the shape file and its height (”HOEHEGEB”). A continuous color scale is used.

![](/img/maps/mapbox_choro_cotinuous_gif.gif)

#### <Highlight> Source Data (Sample) </Highlight>

- "HOEHEGEB": Building heights
- "DACHFORM": Roof shapes (not relevant in this example)

| HOEHEGEB | DACHFORM |
| --- | --- |
| 14.2 | flat |
| 12.0 | gable |
| 34.2 | gable |

### <Highlightsubhead> Choropleth Map - Discrete Color Scale </Highlightsubhead>

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

Same as in previous example, however, now the buildings are colored according to their roof shape (”flat”, “gable”, “shed”) using a  discreet (i.e. categorical) color scale.

### <Highlightsubhead> Choropleth Map - Discrete Color Scale with Slider and Barchart </Highlightsubhead>

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

Same as in previous example, however, now we have a slider where we choose a height threshold. Buildings whose heights fall below this treshold are removed from the map. In addition, a bar chart next to the map shows the amount of remaining buildings grouped by roof shape.

Note: After selecting a new value on the slider, the map must be refreshed (in the upper right corner of the map) to apply the changes. The same goes for the bar chart.

### <Highlightsubhead> Generating New Polygons </Highlightsubhead>

#### <Highlight> Example </Highlight>

So far, we generated our polygons beforehand (i.e. in a GIS) and imported them into the MoLöWe-Server to use them in Mapbox. We can also generate new polygons within Mapbox.

In this example we are generating buffers around trees. The buffer size is defined by the slider input. Each time a new value is selected on the slider, new buffers are generated and then displayed in the map.

Note: After selecting a new value on the slider, the map must be refreshed (in the upper right corner of the map) to apply the changes.

## <Highlighthead> **Creating Map/s Locally** </Highlighthead>

**Pros**

- 

**Cons**

- 

**Loading your Map/s into MoLöWe**

**Two Options:**

- If you want to show only 1 map or switch between less than 5 Maps: **Load Map/s from MoLöWe-Server**
- If you want to switch between more than 5 Maps: **Load Map from Git-Repo**
    - wenn man viele Karten hat, wäre das Importieren in den MoLöWe-Server sehr aufwendig

### Load Map/s from MoLöWe-Server

- Fluss Überschwemmung
- Fluss Überschwemmung mit slider

### Load Map/s from Git-Repo
